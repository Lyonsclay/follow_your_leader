The goal of Poliwonk is to build a service to embolden the democratic aspirations of human beings.
Poliwonk is a service to provide the tools and community to support the aspirations of humans wishing exercise their fundamental rights.
Connecting people with their governments and providing mechanisms to engage in politics.

There are many barriers to the average citizen wishing to become more informed and politically engaged.
One particular barrier is easy access to information about elections and the candidates that are running.
Critical to having a say in any participatory democracy is the act of voting. Of course, this is only as
meaningful as one has a clear understanding of the issues and positions in a particular race.

We are currently developing Follow Your Leader a service to connect you with your representatives.

Did you know that there is no official database of all elected officials in the United States?

We are piloting a project that will crowd source a list of all elected officials according to voting district.

This is a rather ambitious project that I hope will provide a template for curating other data.

We can't wait for government to provide access to, we have to go out and get it.

Alot of organiztions have been looking at the issue.
